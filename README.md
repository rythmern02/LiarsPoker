# Liar's Poker Game 🎲💸

Welcome to **Liar's Poker**, an exciting, decentralized game of bluffing, bidding, and strategy based on **Ethereum smart contracts**! This is the Web3 version of the classic **Liar’s Poker**, where players receive random notes with serial numbers and bid on the occurrence of numbers, trying to bluff and challenge each other to win the pool or lose based on their claims.

This game leverages the **Sepolia testnet** and a smart contract deployed on the **Sepolia network**.

## 🚀 **How to Play**

1. **Get Your Random Notes**  
   At the start of each round, each player is given a random note containing a serial number. The serial number is generated using **secure randomization** to ensure fairness and unpredictability.

2. **Start Bidding**  
   Players bid on the occurrence of a specific serial number. For example, a player may bid that they have **3 notes with serial number 12345**. The other players may believe or challenge this bid based on their own notes and intuition.

3. **Bluff or Challenge**  
   Players have the option to either **bluff** and bid high, or **challenge** the bid if they suspect that someone is lying. The tension builds as players try to figure out if the numbers match the claimed bids.

4. **Winning and Losing**  
   - If the **bluff is successful**, the **challenger loses** their stake, and the **bluffer wins** the pool.
   - If the **challenge is correct**, the **bluffer loses**, and the **challenger wins** the pool.
   - The game continues with new rounds, where players can adjust their strategies, increase their bids, or hold their ground.

5. **Smart Contract Integration**  
   All bets, challenges, and outcomes are settled automatically on the blockchain via our **Sepolia smart contract**.
